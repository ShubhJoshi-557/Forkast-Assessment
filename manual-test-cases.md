## Expected Behavior Summary:

| Taker Order Type | Color    | Arrow | Reason                          |
| ---------------- | -------- | ----- | ------------------------------- |
| BUY              | ðŸŸ¢ Green | â†‘     | Buyer crossed spread (bullish)  |
| SELL             | ðŸ”´ Red   | â†“     | Seller crossed spread (bearish) |

## Key Rules:

1. **Later timestamp = Taker** (order that crossed the spread)
2. **Earlier timestamp = Maker** (order that was on the book)
3. **BUY taker = GREEN + â†‘** (buy pressure)
4. **SELL taker = RED + â†“** (sell pressure)
5. **Same timestamp = Default to BUY** (aggressive buy)

This matches exactly how Binance, Backpack, and other major exchanges display trade history!
